# VeriPresenX

**Verified Presence.** A browser-based, server-authoritative attendance system for
Nigerian universities. Students check in against a rotating code that is only legible
from inside the hall, and every check-in is an atomic server-side transaction.

> Formerly **Attendify**. The app was renamed for trademark safety — several unrelated
> products already use that name. The Firebase project ID remains `attendify-4c93d`;
> see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## The problem it actually solves

Proxy attendance — "I signed for you" — is the core failure of paper and QR systems.
VeriPresenX attacks it at four independent points, so defeating one is not enough:

| Control | What it stops |
| --- | --- |
| **Rotating PIN** (default 10 s) rendered only on the rep's screen in the hall | Screenshot-and-forward. A forwarded PIN is stale within seconds |
| **Atomic server transaction** on every check-in | Double check-in, duplicate rows, roster/attendee divergence |
| **Device lock** — one physical device, many accounts | A single phone checking in a group of friends |
| **Server-authoritative writes** — clients cannot write attendance at all | Anyone crafting a Firestore write from devtools |

Deliberately **online-first**. The server clock is the anti-cheat authority, so there is
no offline queue — see [docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md).

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS PWA — **no framework, no build step** | `index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`, `sw.js` |
| Backend | Vercel serverless functions | `api/*.js`, Node + Firebase Admin SDK |
| Data | Firestore + `firestore.rules` | Rules are the real access boundary |
| Auth | Firebase Auth (email/password) | ID token verified on every endpoint |
| Push | Firebase Cloud Messaging | `firebase-messaging-sw.js` |
| Brand assets | Web-optimized PNG / WebP icons and mark | `brand/` |

There is no bundler, no transpiler and no npm dependency in the shipped app.
`package.json` lists `firebase-admin` only because Vercel resolves it for `api/*.js`.

---

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Node 18+, a Firebase project with Firestore + Auth enabled, and a
service-account key for that project.

```powershell
git clone <repo-url>
cd "ATTENDIFY APP"

npm install          # resolves firebase-admin for the api/ functions
Copy-Item .env.example .env    # then fill in the five values
```

1. **Web config** — set the Firebase web config inline in `app.js` (~line 373) and in
   `firebase-messaging-sw.js`. These values are public by design; they are not secrets.
2. **Env** — fill `.env` from the service-account JSON. See [`.env.example`](.env.example).
3. **Rules** — deploy them before using the app:

   ```powershell
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

4. **Run** — the `api/*.js` handlers need the Vercel runtime, so a plain static server
   will serve the UI but every API call 404s:

   ```powershell
   npx.cmd vercel dev
   ```

   On Windows PowerShell use `npx.cmd` — the `.ps1` shim is blocked by the default
   ExecutionPolicy.

### Deploy

Vercel builds from the repo; `vercel.json` sends `Cache-Control: no-cache` for
`/`, `index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css` and `sw.js`. That is deliberate: a new deploy
must never be served against a cached service worker. Firestore rules deploy through
[`.github/workflows/deploy-firestore-rules.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-firestore-rules.yml).

Set the five env vars in **Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables**.

## How a session works

```text
REP                                    SERVER                         STUDENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
create course (code/dept/level)
start session  ─────────────────────►  write session/live
                                       write session/secret {pin, attendees:[rep]}
PIN + countdown on screen
  rotate every 10s ──────────────────►  {pin, previousPin, pinRotationTime}
                                                                      read PIN off screen
                                       ◄───────────────────────────  POST /attendance?submit
                                       verify token + App Check
                                       recompute freshness from pinAge
                                       runTransaction:
                                         reject if matric already in attendees
                                         write checkins/{uid}_{ts}
                                         union matric into secret.attendees
                                       ─────────────────────────►  ✅
close session + physical headcount ──►  write attendance/session_<ts>
  compare system vs physical count      delete session/live + session/secret
```

The check-in race is closed inside the transaction, not by the client: the
`attendees.includes(matric)` test and the write happen in the same atomic unit, so two
concurrent requests from one matric cannot both succeed.

## Project structure

```text
api/                     6 serverless functions, 13 actions (see below)
utils/appCheck.js        App Check gate — called FIRST by every endpoint
app.js                   the entire client (~7 500 lines, no framework)
index.html               markup + all screen containers
style.css                theming via :root and data-theme="dark"
sw.js                    service worker; cache-first for static assets
firebase-messaging-sw.js FCM background handler
firestore.rules          the access boundary — read this before changing data shapes
vercel.json              cache headers
brand/                   logo, mark, wordmark, app icons and preview sheet
docs/                    architecture, security model, roadmap

## Status

**Functionally complete PWA, demo-ready.** Previously hardened through four internal
audit rounds. Outstanding gaps are catalogued honestly in
[docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md#known-gaps) — notably that PIN rotation
and the 3-strike fail-safe counter are still client-driven, which is what Phase 5
addresses.
